- **Triage**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: Varies by severity (see below)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed

## üéØ Severity Classification

### Critical (24-48 hours)

- Remote code execution
- Complete authentication bypass
- Data breach or exposure of sensitive data
- Complete system compromise

### High (1 week)

- Privilege escalation
- Significant data exposure
- Authentication vulnerabilities
- CSRF in critical functions

### Medium (2-4 weeks)

- XSS vulnerabilities
- Limited information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Input validation issues

### Low (1-3 months)

- Information leakage
- Minor security misconfigurations
- Low-impact CSRF
- Theoretical vulnerabilities

## üîê Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Refresh Tokens**: Separate refresh token mechanism
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permission system
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling
- **Password Security**: Strong password requirements

### Data Protection

- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Encryption at Rest**: Database encryption for sensitive data
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization
- **Output Encoding**: XSS prevention
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries with Prisma

### Infrastructure Security

- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate environments for dev/staging/prod
- **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of API keys and secrets

### Code Security

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security audits of dependencies
- **Static Analysis**: Automated code security scanning
- **Security Testing**: Dedicated security test suites
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused code reviews
- **Secure Defaults**: Security-by-default configuration

## üîß Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

Never commit these to version control:

```bash
# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-refresh-token-secret

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/db

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# API Keys
LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY=your-lighthouse-key
EMAIL_API_KEY=your-email-service-key
```

### Security Headers

Our application implements comprehensive security headers:

```typescript
// Security middleware configuration
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    },
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
  }
}));
```

### Rate Limiting

API endpoints are protected with rate limiting:

```typescript
// Rate limiting configuration
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP',
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false,
});
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Developers

- **Never commit secrets** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for configuration
- **Validate all inputs** on both client and server
- **Sanitize outputs** to prevent XSS
- **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
- **Implement proper error handling** without information leakage
- **Follow principle of least privilege**
- **Regular dependency updates**

### For Deployments

- **Use HTTPS everywhere**
- **Configure proper CORS**
- **Set security headers**
- **Regular security updates**
- **Monitor logs** for suspicious activity
- **Backup and test recovery procedures**
- **Network segmentation**
- **Regular security audits**

### For Users

- **Use strong, unique passwords**
- **Enable two-factor authentication** (when available)
- **Keep your browser updated**
- **Be cautious with third-party integrations**
- **Report suspicious activity**
- **Use official download sources only**

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Testing

```bash
# Security-focused test suites
npm run test:security

# Dependency vulnerability scanning

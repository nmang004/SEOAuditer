# Intelligent Dashboard Routing System Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation of an intelligent dashboard routing system that automatically adapts based on the type of SEO analysis performed (single-page, subfolder, or full domain crawl). The system provides optimized dashboard views for each crawl type while maintaining shared components and consistent user experience.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. AnalysisDashboardRouter
**Location:** `src/components/dashboard/AnalysisDashboardRouter.tsx`

The main routing component that automatically detects crawl type and renders the appropriate dashboard:

```typescript
export function AnalysisDashboardRouter() {
  // Automatic crawl type detection based on analysis data
  // Routes to SinglePageDashboard, SubfolderDashboard, or FullDomainDashboard
  // Handles loading states and error conditions
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Automatic crawl type detection from URL patterns and analysis metadata
- Dynamic component loading based on analysis type
- Centralized configuration management
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

#### 2. SinglePageDashboard
**Location:** `src/components/dashboard/SinglePageDashboard.tsx`

Enhanced single-page analysis dashboard with focused metrics and recommendations:

**Features:**
- Large SEO score display with performance ring
- Quick action buttons (re-analyze, export, share)
- Tabbed interface: Overview, Recommendations, Technical, Content, Performance
- Real-time issue detection and priority recommendations
- Mobile-optimized responsive design

**Components:**
- `ScoreCircle` - Large visual score representation
- `QuickStats` - Key metrics overview
- `RecommendationList` - Prioritized action items
- `IssueBreakdown` - Technical issue categorization

#### 3. SubfolderDashboard
**Location:** `src/components/dashboard/SubfolderDashboard.tsx`

Multi-page analysis dashboard with bulk operations and comparison tools:

**Features:**
- Section-wide metrics (average score, total pages, common issues)
- Page grid with bulk selection and actions
- Advanced filtering and sorting capabilities

#### 4. FullDomainDashboard
**Location:** `src/components/dashboard/FullDomainDashboard.tsx`

Comprehensive site-wide analysis with architecture visualization:

**Features:**
- Domain health scoring with breakdown by category
- Interactive site map with hierarchical navigation
- Critical user path analysis
- Architecture insights and recommendations
- Site structure visualization
- Cross-page content and technical analysis

**Components:**
- `HealthScoreVisual` - Multi-dimensional health scoring
- `InteractiveSiteMap` - Navigable site structure
- `CriticalPaths` - User journey analysis
- `DomainStats` - Site-wide metrics

### Shared Components

#### 5. AdaptiveComponents
**Location:** `src/components/dashboard/shared/AdaptiveComponents.tsx`

Intelligent components that adapt behavior based on crawl type:

**Components:**
- `AdaptiveMetricDisplay` - Context-aware metric presentation
- `MetricCard` - Flexible metric visualization
- `SmartRecommendationList` - Priority-based recommendation engine
- `ContextualInsights` - Type-specific insights and suggestions

**Adaptive Behavior:**
- Metrics selection based on crawl type
- Layout optimization for different data volumes
- Priority weighting adjusted for analysis scope
- Feature availability based on crawl capabilities

#### 6. DashboardNavigation
**Location:** `src/components/dashboard/shared/DashboardNavigation.tsx`

Navigation and interaction components for dashboard management:

**Components:**
- `AnalysisTypeSwitcher` - Switch between related analyses
- `DashboardActions` - Common actions (export, share, schedule)
- `DashboardBreadcrumb` - Hierarchical navigation
- `QuickNavigation` - Tab-based navigation
- `AnalysisStatusIndicator` - Real-time status display
- `DashboardHeader` - Unified header with actions

### API Integration

#### 7. Dashboard Configuration API
**Location:** `src/app/api/analyses/[id]/dashboard-config/route.ts`

RESTful API for dashboard configuration management:

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/analyses/[id]/dashboard-config` - Retrieve dashboard configuration
- `POST /api/analyses/[id]/dashboard-config` - Update dashboard preferences

**Configuration Schema:**
```typescript
interface DashboardConfig {
  dashboardType: 'single' | 'subfolder' | 'domain';
  layout: {
    showSiteMap: boolean;
    showCrossPageInsights: boolean;
    showBulkActions: boolean;
    primaryMetrics: string[];
    defaultView: string;
    tabs: string[];
  };
  features: string[];
  permissions: string[];
  customization: {
    theme: string;
    viewPreferences: Record<string, any>;
  };
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Crawl Type Detection Algorithm

The system uses multiple strategies to determine crawl type:

1. **URL Pattern Analysis:**
   - Single page: Specific URL with path and parameters
   - Subfolder: Directory path with trailing slash
   - Domain: Root domain or wildcard patterns

2. **Analysis Metadata:**
   - Page count indicators
   - Crawl depth information
   - Discovery method flags

3. **Configuration Override:**
   - Explicit type specification
   - User preferences
   - Project settings

### Adaptive UI Logic

**Metric Selection:**
- Single Page: Score, Issues, Recommendations, Load Time
- Subfolder: Average Score, Page Count, Common Issues, Coverage
- Domain: Site Health, Crawl Coverage, Critical Paths, Architecture

**Layout Optimization:**
- Column count adapts to data density
- Component sizing based on importance
- Feature availability by analysis scope

**Navigation Patterns:**
- Tab structure varies by analysis type
- Breadcrumb depth reflects analysis scope
- Action availability based on permissions

### Performance Optimizations

**Component Loading:**
- Lazy loading of dashboard-specific components
- Conditional imports based on detected type
- Shared component reuse across dashboards

**Data Management:**
- Efficient state management with React Query
- Optimistic updates for configuration changes
- Cached analysis data with invalidation strategies

**Rendering Performance:**
- Memoized expensive calculations
- Virtual scrolling for large page lists
- Progressive enhancement for complex visualizations
